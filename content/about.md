## The Polymath

I am a dual-degree student in **Computer Science** and **Mathematics**, building at the intersection of computational reasoning and physical discipline.

As the next steps to my plan, once my two bachelor's degrees are completed, I'll eventually pursue post-baccalaureates in both **Physics** and **Data Science**, to eventually apply for a PhD in **Astrophysics**.

My goal is not just to learn, but to synthesize. To merge the rigor of **Astrophysics** and **Data Science** with the discipline of **Elite Calisthenics**. So of course, you'll see both the intellectual and physical aspects of my life here, hopefully I'll be able to share what I'm passionate about, while I continuously grow and help others.

Just remember, I'm a beginner! I'll make mistakes, probably many over time, but I'm open to learning and correcting myself. This is where I'll document my growth and discoveries, who knows what the future will bring?

*If I have seen further, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.*

## The Lab (Intellectual Pursuit)
My work focuses on high-performance computing, astrophysical simulations, and machine learning. I am currently executing a 20-year roadmap called **"Project Titan"**. It took me a long time to define a final path of pursuit, but as I always suggest, the best way to find your ultimate direction is to actually start walking to where even your faintest of ideas lead you. Eventually, the fog will lift and you'll see clearly.

### Core Competencies
* **Languages:** Python (proficient), C++, SQL, LaTeX (working on them!)
* **Focus:** Astrophysics & Data Science

### Certificates & Education
* **B.Sc. Computer Science** - UCB (In Progress)
* **B.Sc. Mathematics** - Uninter (In Progress)
* **Kaggle:** Intro to Programming, Python, Intro to Machine Learning, Pandas, Intermediate Machine Learning, Data Visualization (6/17 Completed)

I've surely acquired many more certifications during my studies, although these won't be mentioned here because I intend to only keep what's currently relevant to my actual goals and inclinations. But if you're curious, I've started my journey getting proficient with the main programming languages: *HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript*. Eventually I realized that *Python* is my favourite, even though I still do intend to master *C++*.

## The Temple (Physical Mastery)
I view the body as an instrument that must be tuned as finely as the mind. My training revolves around bodyweight mastery, although I do enjoy lifting weights from time to time, especially to keep my legs well developed. Nothing brings me as much joy as being able to freely control my body through space.

One must remember that although our minds are the means through which we interpret and understand the universe, our bodies are the vessels that manifest our will into the world.

* **Main Goals:** One-Arm Chin-Up, Freestanding HSPU.
* **Secondary Goal:** Full Front Lever.
* **Current Stats:** 1.88m, 93kg, 9-11% body fat.

At the moment, I can proudly say that I've been training for 10 consecutive years, the journey so far has been long and weary, and greatly rewarding at the same time. I've learned everything I know from *videos, books and constant practice*. I know my progress hasn't been the fastest, but I've learned valuable insights in the meantime, which I'll gladly share with whoever is open to hearing.

I'm starting to share at a moment in which I'm extremely close to achieving my main goals, so eventually, as you'll see, these goals will broaden to the actual *elite calisthenics skills*. So, thank you for tagging along!

## Lifestyle
When I am not compiling code or training, I am curating a life of depth (or at least, trying to!).
* **Music:** Guitar (Fingerstyle & Electric).
* **Reading:** Philosophy, Hard Sci-Fi, Horror, Physics, History, Classics, etc.
