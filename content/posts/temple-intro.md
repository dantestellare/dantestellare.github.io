## The Philosophy of the Temple

The body is not a vanity project; it is the hardware upon which the mind runs. A weak chassis cannot support a high-performance engine.

It's of ultimate necessity to treat our body with the importance it deserves, as it is *the means through which we express our will onto the world*. In the same way that the mind must be trained to be as sharp as possible so that we can achieve our ultimate potential, the same goes for our vessel (quite philosophical, isn't it?). Doing so will maximize everything we do, while bringing along some well-deserved self-esteem.

My training philosophy is built on **Calisthenics Mastery**, which can be described as the ability to manipulate one's own body weight through space with absolute control. But don't be fooled; calisthenics shouldn't be considered as it mostly is by those misinformed by the mainstream media. It most certainly will develop a muscular body, along with a high level of strength.

Can you imagine the body one must have to perform one-arm pull-ups and handstand push-ups? A gym machine's full stack will be a joke to elite athletes.

You don't need much to look like a Greek God. Thank you for following my journey, and welcome to "The Temple", where I'll share my progress and possibly help you with your own.

And, just as a matter of context: I'm currently 25 years old, with 10 years of training. Most of what I've learned comes from books, videos, and persistent practice. Although my levers are quite long (1.88m tall) and I'm a heavy man (93kg currently), I'm extremely close to achieving many advanced moves.

Let's do this! Welcome once more.
