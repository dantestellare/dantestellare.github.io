## The Philosophy of the Lab

After years of intense work and research, I'm confident that I now have the means to share my most ambitious and passionate projects with you!

**The Lab** will be exactly what its name implies: *our comfortable laboratory to examine, create, and break things!*

I will not dwell on this section, but if you're curious about who I am and what I do, and have a few minutes of free time at hand, you just might have a look at the "About" section.

Make no mistake, I'm a beginner who's willing to share my journey and progress, and so far, the future looks quite promising!

## Upcoming Project

My first project, as you'll soon see (and hopefully learn), will be specifically about simulating a **Schwarzschild Black Hole** using Python. This is the simplest type of black hole one may find, as it is stationary (it doesn't rotate), is perfectly symmetrical, and doesn't have an electric charge. It is perfect to understand this magnificent phenomenon which happens under ideal circumstances.

I'll explain the historical context behind it, along with the theory, how to break down the mathematical equations into simpler concepts, and of course, the code will be available as well, with its respective comments to explain the **why** of each computational decision.

**Mathematics** and **Physics** might be daunting, but I'll make sure to explain complex formulas, such as these:

$$\frac{d^2x^\mu}{d\tau^2} + \Gamma^{\mu}_{\alpha\beta}\frac{dx^\alpha}{d\tau}\frac{dx^\beta}{d\tau} = 0$$
> Geodesic Equation

$$G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}$$ 
> Einstein Field Equation

I will break these down in an understandable way, even if you're not familiar with the language.

So, to wrap it up, know that I'm thankful for your presence during my path towards excellence, in the hopes of inspiring and being helpful to those who are curious. I'll be thrilled to know about your journey as well, make sure to get in touch!

All the best.

- Dante
